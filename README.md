# Spam Mail Prediction with Linear Regression Model

## Overview

Welcome to the Spam Mail Prediction project! This project is designed to classify email messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) using a Linear Regression model. Linear Regression is usually used for regression tasks, but in this project, we'll adapt it for a binary classification problem.
